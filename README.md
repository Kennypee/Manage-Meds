# Manage-Meds
Medical Manager. Helps patients keep track of their pills intake with constant reminders and notifications

The project is based on the MVVM architecture and i have also implemented some other components to achieve the desired features. 
* LiveData
* Room
* DataBinding
* ButterKnife
* etc

The App flows in a smooth manner >> Login >> Dashboard >> Add Meds >> Save. then get notified when it's time. users can edit/update profile, med data, search for meds etc.
